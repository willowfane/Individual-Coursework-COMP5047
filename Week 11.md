Society Leader App: a mobile app to run on mobile phones and on desktop or tablet computers for society leader to organise and operator societies.

Diagrams:
This week, i have completed both the Class and the Sequence diagrams, which have been sent to the team to be reviewed. 
As a team, we have also completed the UML Component Diagram which shows the architecture of the whole system.

Issues Solved:
Ever since i connected my papyrus to the team github, the commits dont seem to be working. I spoke to the professor in the practical session today to address the issue. 
However it still has not been resolved and we are unsure why the commits are failing.


Reflection on Teamwork:
The team has worked very well this week, with everyone coming in for an extra meeting to finish connecting everyone subsystems for the whoel system component diagram.


This week we submitted our coursework.
