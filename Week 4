## Issues Solved:
One issue that i solved after our weekly meeting was that the 'Individual Meeting Notes' are meant to be on github. 
I was previously doing them on google drive, and so that is why the commits from week 3 will be todays date. 



## Reflection on Teamwork:
We are working well so far, at the beginning of this week we set a goal for everyone to be completely finished with task 2. Additionally, 
we presented our work and everyone gave each other reviews.
