## Issues Solved
As I was absent from the first lecture in week 1 due to Jury Service, 
I had to catch up with all the work I missed. Therefore in week 2, 
I firstly read the ‘COMP5047_CW-Spec_2025’. 

This allowed me to understand exactly what the coursework was about and 
what I needed to do in order to prepare to start. Additionally, 
whilst reading this document I also highlighted the key information. 
Then I read ‘COMP5047-CW- Case Study - Student Unions’. 
Once I read and highlighted both documents I knew what to do. 
Then after our team meeting, we had each selected one subsystem to work on.

I was assigned:
1) 	Society Leader App: a mobile app to run on mobile phones and on desktop or tablet 
    computers for society leader to organise and operator societies.
Therefore I started to write some notes from the information I gathered from the case study,
but also made a plan on how i was to tackle the coursework with deadlines. 

## Reflection on Teamwork:
I would say that all 4 of the team members work well together. For example we are 
communicating on google chat, this is where we check who is going to be present at the meeting,
also where we can ask each other questions if we are confused.
