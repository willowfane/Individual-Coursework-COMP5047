## Subsystem
1) 	Society Leader App: a mobile app to run on mobile phones and on desktop or tablet 
    computers for society leader to organise and operator societies.


## Diagrams:
- Completed the use case diagram
- Completed the Activity Diagram
- Started the UML component diagram

## Issues Solved:
- So as i said last week, i would try and finish the UML component diagram. However, this past week i have been trying to complete it, but my software is being very glitchy and also i am struggling to understand what to do.
- Therefore, in this weeks group meeting i will be asking for help from my group memeber and hopefully they can aid me with creating this diagram. So that for next week, we can connect them all for task 4b
- By the end of this week, i have completed the UML component diagram and so now need to just make it look more understandable


## Reflection on Teamwork:
- The team is working well, everyone but Imraz found the UML Component diagram hard to create (including myself).
- Additionally, abdullah hasnt been turning up to the meetings so we dont have a clue of how much he has actually done.
