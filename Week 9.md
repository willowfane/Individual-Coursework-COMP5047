## Diagrams:

## Issues Solved:
- So as i said last week, i would try and finish the UML component diagram. However, this past week i have been trying to complete it, but my software is being very glitchy and also i am struggling to understand what to do.
- Therefore, in this weeks group meeting i will be asking for help from my group memeber and hopefully they can aid me with creating this diagram. So that for next week, we can connect them all for task 4b
