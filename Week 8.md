## Subsystem
1) 	Society Leader App: a mobile app to run on mobile phones and on desktop or tablet 
    computers for society leader to organise and operator societies.



## Diagrams:
- Completed the use case diagram
- Completed the Activity Diagram
- Started the UML component diagram, and will hopefully finish this by the end of today

## Issues Solved:
- I didnt understand how to create or really understand what a UML component diagram was. Therefore i went back to the week 6 practical notes and read the document, thus i now know how to create it and so will be starting it today.
  - Once i have completed all three diagrams, i will share them with the team and ask them to give feedback and any issues, so i complete them in time for when we combine all our UMl diagrams together next week.


## Reflection on Teamwork:
- So far we are all working well together, we all turn up to the meetings and discuss our coursework plans for the week and set goals. Additionally, we are constantly reviewing and giving advice/feedback on each others coursework.
