## Subsystem
1) 	Society Leader App: a mobile app to run on mobile phones and on desktop or tablet 
    computers for society leader to organise and operator societies.


## Diagrams:
- Completed the use case diagram
- Completed the Activity Diagram
- Started the UML component diagram

This week, i will try to complete all of the coursework or atleast task 4b and 5a. So that i can get this coursework done asap and start revising for my exams.

## Issues Solved:
- The UML component diagram is finally complete, now we need to conenct them all together for task 4b. 
-  One problem which i have encountered, is that i am not sure that my Papyrus and github was properly connected, and so it might not be able to have a version history.
-  I am struggling a lot with the Papyrus software, i keep losing some of my diagrams and unsure as to why.
- We were struggling to connect the component diagrams as we had to all be present because it had to have been done on one computer.


## Reflection on Teamwork:
- It has been hard to really work as a team, as it seems that only Imraz and I are taking the coursework seriously. We have both completed the UML component diagram and we are unsure as to whether the other two members have completed theirs. 
- This has cause a delay in our coursework as we cant complete 4b if we havent got their diagrams, and so we are both considering going ahead with the tasks without them.
